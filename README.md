Pentest Reports for Capture the Flag events

This is a collection of Penetration Test writeups and walkthroughs for various Capture the Flag platforms.  These are examples for education purposes, and to practice writing.

All reports will be password protected with the last challange flag obtained on the machine.

Retired machines, or machines that are not under any publication restrictions will have the flag used to encrypt the pdfs in the flags.txt file.

Do not contact me for flags not listed in the flags.txt.  I will not give them out.
