Pentest Reports for Capture the Flag events

This is a collection of Penetration Test reports written up for various Capture the Flag platforms as if a machine were part of an official engagement.  These are examples for education purposes, and to practice writing.  The reports are not real, and do not represent any network or machine outside of the Capture the Flag platform hosting the machine.

These reports are not published with any consent of the Capture the Flag platforms.  With that said, any report representing an active machine will be password protected with the last challange flag obtained on the machine.
